//Modify the singly linked list to be a doubly linked list. Now write a routine that removes all duplicate data in the doubly linked list.
//The data will be integers generated at random from [0,49]. Initially have a list of 200 elements.  
//Now do this in one of two ways.  Sort the list by its data field. Remove adjacent elements of the sorted list with the same value.
//Or, take the first elementâ€”search the remainder of the list for elements with the same data and remove them.
//Then take the second element and do the same. Repeat until only one element is left.
